### First Homework 
**fileName**:analogRGBControl   
**Description**:Controlling the colors of the RGB LED by reading the value of the 3 potentiometers (rInValue, gInValue, bInValue) and mapping each one to a color: R(rOutValue), G(gOutValue), or B(bOutValue). I created setColor function inside I used map function to map the values and then function analogWrite to send them to the RGB LED.
